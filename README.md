# Access to Google Speech-to-Text REST API via javascript

Example of accessing to Google Speech-to-Text REST API via Javascript

vi src/js/constants.js  // add your API key
```

## Start demo

npm start
```

## Disclaimer
- Since there is no official example of how to access Google Speech-to-Text REST API via javascript, this code may not be working in the future.
- This code should be run on HTTPS environment otherwise getUserMedia() will give you an error.
- I use redux and redux-saga to make it clear and understandable (for myself at least) but it doesn't have to be this way.
