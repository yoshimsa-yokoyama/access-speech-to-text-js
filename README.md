# Access to Google Speech-to-Text REST API via javascript

Example of accessing to Google Speech-to-Text REST API via Javascript

## Setup

```
npm i
src/js/constants.js  // add your API key
```



## Disclaimer
- Since there is no official example of how to access Google Speech-to-Text REST API via javascript so this code may not be working in the future.
- This code should be run on HTTPS environment otherwise getUserMedia() will an error
- I use redux and redux-saga to make it clear and understandable (for myself at least) but it doesn't have to be this way.
